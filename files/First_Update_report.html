<h1>Project Name: Physically based simulation for soft objects</h1>
<p>Ziyan Xiong</p>
<h2>Summary of work to date</h2>
<p class="para">Currently, I have completed a simple simulator. It can simulate the collision of particles with the ground and walls as in the Fig.1. I use the blue balls to represent each particle. By assigning their initial position and velocity, their movements are calculated automatically thorough updating their position and velocity in next time step based on the force applied on each particle. In this example, the particles are affected by the gravity and dampen force to make the system stable. </p>

<p class="para"> I then add the mass and spring system to the simulator. With this mass and spring system, the particles can interact with each other. The effects are shown in Fig.2. Now each particle is connected to others with a spring. When the distance between two particles are longer or shorter than the rest length of this spring, the system will generate a spring force applied on related particles to make them stay close to the rest length. The stiffness of this spring is controlled by a variable ks. With smaller ks, the movement of a particle group will look like fluid and with bigger ks it will look like solid body. However, it is still not realistic in both simulating the fluid and solid using the spring and mass system only. A more terrible consequence is that the system will become extremely unstable with large ks. Even a small time step will cause the simulation to explode. The time step which is small enough to make the system stable will be too small to make any progress in the simulation.</p>

<p class="para"> There are many existing solutions to this problem, I choose to use the constrained dynamics. This approach will calculate extra constraints for each particle. One of the constraint is making the distance between two particles a constant instead of using the spring to connect particles which is like connecting them with a rod. By choosing specific constraints, the collision between particles and connecting particles with ropes can be easily achieved. Fig.3 shows a soft cube falls into the ground. The center particle is connecting with each particles using the 'rod' and the rest of them are connecting with each other using the spring.</p>
